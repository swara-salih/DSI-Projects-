# Data Science: Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is divided into 5 deliverables, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

### Identify Problem
- Define problem statement / topic.
- Define goals & success criteria.
- Define potential audience(s).
- Research field to gain subject matter insight.

### Acquire Data
- Data quality assessment - be sure the data is useful to your problem!
- Identify assumptions and risks of your data.
- Think about additional data that could add value.

*If you plan on interacting with an API or scraping data read up on that websites or API's terms of service so that you do not run into any data acquisition issues in the future.* 

### Mine, Parse and EDA
- Explore data to better understand it.
- Confirm that the data can be manipulated to help solve your defined problem.
- Extract data you found necessary.
- Drop data that is not relevant.
- Calculate summary statistics and summarize relevant insights.

### Data Analysis and Modeling
- Plot data for visually analyzing data.
- Run model on data - be sure to train on subsets as you deem appropriate.
- Tune model parameters and evaluate model's performance.
- Perform advanced statistical analyses and summarize findings.

### Conclusion (Presentation and Write Up)
- Discuss problem and how you propose your project will affect it.
- Discuss statistical analyses and visualizations.
- Discuss model selection and implementation processes.
- Interpret findings and relate to goals/criteria.
- Create recommendations for stakeholders & summarize next steps.
- *Bonus:* Deploy concept or propose a strategy for deploying your end product.
